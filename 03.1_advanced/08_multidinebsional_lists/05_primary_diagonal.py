""" 5.	Primary Diagonal
Write a program that finds the sum of all numbers in a matrix's primary diagonal
(runs from top left to bottom right). On the first line,
you will receive an integer N â€“ the size of a square matrix.
The next N lines holds the values for each column - N numbers,
separated by a single space.
