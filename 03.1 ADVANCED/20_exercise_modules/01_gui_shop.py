Problems for exercise and homework for the Python Advanced Course @SoftUni.

It is important, when developing an application, to actually choose the tools and libraries,
which will help us achieve the implementation. Today, we are going to use tkinter and some
other dependencies for images and etc.
Please, feel free to change the implementation of steps, adding or removing certain pieces of code,
debug the code and play around, so that you could fully understand the logic.
You can look at the photos of the app's flow first, try to implement it, and then look at the description.
This section will show you the end result and some blurry code pics. Try to implement that on your own.
If you face difficulties you can help yourself with the code from GitHub for the current commit
(a link to the current commit will be left at the end of each section)

We have to define our main functionalities:
1.	Register and log in
2.	List all products
3.	Buy product
