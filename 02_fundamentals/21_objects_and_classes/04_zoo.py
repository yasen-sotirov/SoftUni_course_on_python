"""" Create a class Zoo. It should have a class attribute called __animals
that stores the total count of the animals in the zoo. The __init__ method should
only receive the name of the zoo. There you should also create 3 empty lists (mammals, fishes, birds).
The class should also have 2 more methods:
•	add_animal(species, name) - based on the species, adds the name to the corresponding list
•	get_info(species) - based on the species returns a string in the following format:
"{Species} in {zoo_name}: {names}
Total animals: {total_animals}"
On the first line, you will receive the name of the zoo. On the second line,
you will receive number n. On the following n lines you will receive animal
info in the format: "{species} {name}". Add the animal to the zoo to the corresponding list.
The species could be "mammal", "fish", or "bird".
On the final line, you will receive a species.
At the end, print the info for that species and the total count of animals in the zoo.
