""" You will receive three integer numbers.
Write functions named:
â€¢	sum_numbers() that returns the sum of the first two integers
â€¢	subtract() that returns the difference between the returned result of the first function and the third integer
Wrap the two functions in a function named add_and_subtract() which will receive the three numbers as parameters.
Print the result of the subtract() function on the console.
